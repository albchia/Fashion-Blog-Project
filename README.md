# Fashion Blog Project

A very simple website -a Fashion Blog- initially built only within HTML.

This is one of the projects I realized during the Codecademy Course "Intro to HTML".

### Project Overview

Title: _"Fashion Blog"_

> GitHub: [link](https://github.com/albchia/Fashion-Blog-Project.git)

This is a common flow for front-end web developers: typically provided with a design prototype that needs to be translated to a functional actual website.

The design prototype used in this project is inspired by fashion blogs. The task is to create the very basic and simple structure of the page, starting playing with HTML elements.

### Project Instructions

Feel free to customize information and style so long as you follow the following rules.
For inspiration, you can try playing around with `background-colors` and `border-radius`.
You can even add a `box-shadow` around the card.

#### Customize _card.html_

1. Replace the placeholder image in `card.html` with your favorite animal's image and information. Don't forget to change the `alt` attribute of the image to the name of the animal chosen.

2. Modify `card.html` to include attributes so that you can use `CSS selectors` to style the specific elements required. Important to use meaningful names for CSS classes.

3. Link the `style.css` in your `card.html`. Pay attention to not include any `style` elements or style attributes in the body of the `card.html`.

4. Replace current information with your animal's information:
    - Animal's name
    - Interesting facts about the animal
    - Lists of items for your animal's characteristics
    - Animal's brief description

#### Customize _style.css_

The `style.css` should apply the following styles to match the design prototype:

- Use an image with a `width` of 300 pixels. If the image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your CSS, but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted
- The entire card's width should be fixed and it should include the spacing around the image (since image is 300 pixels wide, card should be 300 pixels + spacing on either side). The card should not expand with the browser window
- Italicized text for the animal's interesting facts
- Bolded labels for the animal's list items (only labels, not the entire list)
- No dots for the animal's list items
- Border around the animal's name, image and information (make sure you set the `border-style`, `border-width` and `border-color`; it's possible to do it in one line)
- Spacing around the animal's name, image, the list of items and information (you will need to use the property [padding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding))
